Employee Management System
This Employee Management System is a full-stack application designed to efficiently manage employee data, including personal details, salary information, and category-based classifications. The system allows administrators to:

Add, edit, and delete employees.
View employee lists with details such as name, email, salary, address, and category.
Upload employee profile images.
Filter employees based on categories.
Manage categories for organizing employees.
Securely handle authentication for admins with JWT-based tokens.
The backend is built using Node.js (Express) and PostgreSQL, connected via Supabase. The frontend is developed with React.js, and the system is deployed using Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend. The project also integrates bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for secure authentication.
